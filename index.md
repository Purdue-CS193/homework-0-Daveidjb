# Daveid's First CS19300 Homework!



## My Favorite things about CS19300

- The useful skills i've learned so far
- The magic word! If found in a class, your grade *magically* goes up
- Small class size! Most my classes have hundreds in them, so it is nicce to have a smaller class for once.
- Fun flavor text in assignments and lectures, to make them more interesting
